"Subject: non - firm power curve building  hi vince ,  amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for each region from david hoog ' s double trigger folks . the objective , as they explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david ' s outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve to mark the non - firm position .  my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in david hoog ' s court to build the curve if david wants to sell his product internally to the desk .  assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define "" non - firm "" ? the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david ' s outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation . consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the "" non - firm curve for the region "" ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or group of units .  maybe i could get your thoughts later today .  thanks ,  vasant",0

"Subject: non - firm power curve building  hi vince ,  amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for  each region from david hoog ' s double trigger folks . the objective , as they  explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david ' s  outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve  to mark the non - firm position .  my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but  it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they  have put the ball in david hoog ' s court to build the curve if david wants to  sell his product internally to the desk .  assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define "" non - firm "" ?  the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific  generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david ' s  outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of  non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to  give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem  anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a  unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation .  consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the "" non - firm curve for the  region "" ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or  group of units .  maybe i could get your thoughts later today .  thanks ,  vasant",0

( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the  model ( s ) we ? prefer ) . we therefore try and give ? as clear account as possible  of the advantage and disadvantages of all the ? models so that the reader can  make an informed choice as to the models which ? best suit their needs .  in order to meet our objectives the ? book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to ?  model and  price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the ? book . in  addition to introducing ? the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline ? the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and  monte carlo simulation for ? derivative pricing , which are used throughout the  book .  in chapter 2 we discuss the ? analysis of spot energy prices . as ? well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes ? that  can  be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric  brownian motion as well as ? mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump  processes , discussing each and ? showing how they can be simulated and their  parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince ? kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron  corp . , discusses volatility ? estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this  chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail the methods , ?  merits  and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different ? pricing  models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity  markets are used to illustrate ? the technical and interpretative aspects of  calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves ? in the energy markets . although ? such  curves  are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial ? markets , the  difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well ? defined  curves .  in this chapter we ? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the  building of forward ? curves from market instruments . we ? outline the three  main  approaches which have been applied to building forward ? curves in energy  markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and ? deriving  analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors .  chapter 5 presents an overview of ? structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy  swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options ,  and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and ? multi - factor models of the energy spot  price  and the pricing of some standard ? energy derivatives . closed form ? solutions  for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices ? both on  the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in ? this  chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of ? path dependent and american style options  can  be evaluated for the models in ? chapter 6 . simulation schemes are ? developed  for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety ? of  path  dependent options . in order ? to price options which incorporate early  exercise  opportunities , a trinomial ? tree scheme is developed . this tree ? is built to  be  consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to ? price exotic  as  well as standard european and american style options .  chapter 8 describes a methodology ? for valuing energy options based on  modelling  the whole of the market observed ? forward curve . the approach results ? in a  multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures  can be of an extremely general ? form . closed - form solutions are ? developed  for  pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo ? schemes are  presented for pricing exotic options . the chapter closes with a discussion of  the valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk ? management of energy derivative positions . ?  in  this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions ? that  trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem ?  of  managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio  containing derivatives and look ? at extensions to gamma hedging ?  illustrating  the techniques using both spot and ? forward curve models . the general ? model  presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a ?  portfolio  of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  chapter 10 examines the key risk ? management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing ? energy derivative products . after ?  discussing  the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ? ( volatilities ,  covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours  major ? methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical  simulation and ? monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio  of  energy ? options . in this chapter we also ? look at testing the var estimates  for  various underlying energy market ? variables .  finally , in chapter 11 we review ? modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look  in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) )  and ? creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial ? products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed  information is publicly available . together these provide an extensive set ?  of  tools with which to measure credit risk . we present numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  before ? we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book  are tools ? which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how  both  the ? tool ? ? and the market works . the ? techniques we describe are certainly  not  ? magic wands ? which can be waved at ? data and risk management problems to  provide instant and perfect solutions . to quote from the riskmetrics  technical  document ? ? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and  professional judgement in managing risk . ? . ? however , the right tools ,  correctly  used make the job a lot ? easier !",0

 just 90 days after following my systems ,  pat watson was $ 20 , 000 wealthier !  listen , you ' ve heard all the get rich now claims and you ' re sick of  seeing them ! the fact is most of those  people who claim to know how you can make money haven ' t made much money  themselves let alone taught others how to do it !  the difference between them and me is that i ' ve proven my  strategies time and time again in the national limelight and my systems truly  work in fact , i ' ve been dubbed america ' s # 1 millionaire maker .  right now , america and i need you for my upcoming nationwide tour to share your story of upcoming success and wealth to those who need hope - all across america .  let me tell you about a few of my "" money challenges "" . . . this is where i put my money where my mouth is :  i was also challenged by the los angeles times :  you might remember when the los angeles times challenged me to buy real  estate with nothing down . with a reporter by my side , $ 100 for living expenses ,  and armed only with my knowledge ; i purchased 7 properties worth $ 772 , 000 , all  in 57 hours .  i told the mayor of st louis missouri ( the show me state ) :  send me to any unemployment line . let me select someone who is broke , out of  work , discouraged . let me teach him in  two days time the secrets of wealth , and in 90 days he ' ll be back on his feet ,  with $ 5 , 000 cash in the bank , never to set foot in an employment line again .  i selected a young couple from the unemployment lines of st . louis , missouri .  ninety days later they earned $ 5 , 000 using one of my techniques , and . . . .  within 12 months they had earned over $ 100 k !  my proudest moments are when i coach starving millionaires ( people  who should be millionaires but aren ' t ) on wealth building strategies and see  them achieve extraordinary results , again and again !  i ' ve done these same challenges in other major cities - washington , d . c . ,  miami , boston , san diego , and new york - all with similar results !  this brings me to my next challenge in which i took all of the hype out  of the high - powered profit potential of the internet , and decided to make it a  reality for my students . i said :  sit me at any key board of any computer in the world with internet  access , and i will in 24 hours , earn at least $ 24 , 000 cash !  i got myself into the life or death mindset and i went to work  i started my internet challenge at exactly at 12 : 38 pm in front of live  television , i held my breath , and turned my system on and signed on to the  internet  in 6 hours and 11 minutes i had generated $ 46 , 684 . 95  then i went to sleep . . . and when i woke up the next morning and checked the computer -  ( with cameras rolling ) :  the total was now $ 78 , 827 . 44  this was exciting because i knew i still had four hours left !  that afternoon , 24 hours after the challenge had begun . . .  the total had grown to $ 94 , 532 . 44  in a mere 24 hours !  why do i tell you all of this ?
